Convolutional Neural Networks for solving algebra problems visually

## Dependencies
This model is built on Keras with a tensorflow backend

## Goal
This repository seeks to teach a neural network to do algebra by simply showing it images of problems.

## Problem Generation
Originally this repo relied on problems generated by the excellent generator at Math.com, but for purposes of ensuring proper train/val/test split, it now generates its own simple algebra problems.

## Architecture
The backbone of the model used is the first 3 'blocks' of the Keras impelementation of ResNet50. From there, one output is used to predict how many of each character the model is seeing (1,2,3...x,y,z). Then a few FC layers and a final prediction layer.

## Results
After 100 epochs of training on 8000 simple algebraic expressions and 2000 'identity' expressions (i.e. x = 21), the model has not yet converged. However the results are already beginning to be reasonable:
